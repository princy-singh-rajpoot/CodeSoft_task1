# Simple Calculator

This is a simple command-line calculator written in Python. It allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

2. **Input Numbers**: You'll be prompted to enter two numbers.

3. **Choose an Operation**: Select the operation you want to perform:
   - `1` for Addition (+)
   - `2` for Subtraction (-)
   - `3` for Multiplication (*)
   - `4` for Division (/)

4. **View the Result**: The result of the operation will be displayed.

5. **Repeat or Exit**: You can choose to perform another calculation or exit the program.

## Error Handling

- **Invalid Numbers**: If you enter non-numeric input, the program will notify you and prompt for valid numbers.
- **Division by Zero**: If you attempt to divide by zero, the program will display an error message and prompt you to enter a new operation.

## Example Usage
